    static is applied to variables, methods, blocks, nested classes.
    static belongs to a class.
    this means we'll create only one instance of that static member that is shared across the classes.
    when we declare a field static, exactly a single copy of that field is created and shared among all the instances
    of that class.
    it is stored in heap memory.
